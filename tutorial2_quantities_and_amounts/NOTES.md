## Assignment Notes

Using demo code, I had trouble placing an x-axis even when adapting y-axis code 
(also cross checked other tutorials online)

However, with the commented code on the bottom of main.js, which I experimented with and adapted from a bunch of resources, I am able to draw both axes. 

I could also do interactivity with the bottom code, but could not get it to work with demo code.
