      <h2>🌍 How <i>happy</i> is the world? 🙂</h2>
      <p>Since 2012, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network & Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Development 
        have surveyed people across the globe about their subjective wellbeing and perceived happiness. <br><br>The six factors that are hypothesized to
        contribute to happiness are: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption. Individuals
        rate their happiness based on an assessment of their own lives via the Cantril ladder scale, where they rank themselves a ladder
        of 10 steps, with higher numbers indicating greater happiness.
        <br><br><b>Let's take a look at the relationship between <u>healthy life expectancy</u> and <i>happiness</i> across various regions around the world in 2020.</b></p>
