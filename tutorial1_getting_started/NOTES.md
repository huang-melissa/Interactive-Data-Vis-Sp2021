## My notes for tutorial 1

- Initially couldn't get alert on js to update on deployed site (changes were pushed successfully)
    - resolved by re-ordering the script on index.html, so that the main.js file was before d3.js 
```
<script src="main.js"></script>
<script src="../lib/d3.js"></script>
```

- Most-up-to-date changes on index.html are showing [here](https://huang-melissa.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/tutorial1_getting_started/index.html), but old version persists [here](https://huang-melissa.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/tutorial1_getting_started/)
